Final Project for CoE 197F: Semantic Segmentation

This is a replication of the code from [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Advanced-Deep-Learning-with-Keras/tree/master/chapter12-segmentation),
as part of the requirements for CoE 197F. Thus, the function names,
structure of the code, etc. are similar, except that this is a
PyTorch implementation (as opposed to a Keras implementation).
